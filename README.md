This bot was the first bot I've ever made. It is made on Python and uses Panda's Framework
to read the CSV's files where the information is contained. 
The bot asks you for the name of the Character you want to retrieve information, and it will give you the best build you can use on that character.
It was a very fun project where I learned about Pandas, read csv files and helped me to learn more advanced python.
